          <h2 class="subtitle">Homework</h2>
          <p>Let’s practice what you learned in this class. You will read data, transform columns, subset dataset, plot and extract information.</p>
<p>Write a script that reads the datasets “indicators2050.csv” and “cities.csv”, and joins them on the column <code>city_id</code>. This dataset contain 2050 target values for population, households and employment. Using the R functionality you learned, can you answer the following <strong>questions</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How many cities are in the dataset?</li>
<li>Check if there are any cities with zero population and if yes, exclude them from further analysis.</li>
<li>What is the projected mean households size in the region?</li>
<li>Can you create a histogram of household size with a blue vertical line showing the 2050 median household size, and a black vertical line showing the current median household size which is 2.71? Can you figure how to limit the range of the x-axis to (1,4)?</li>
<li>Which cities have projected employment per capita larger than 50?</li>
<li>Consider cities with population between 1000 and 50000. Is there a clear outlier in the relationship between households and employment in those cities? Do majority of cities of this size have more jobs than households?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps</strong> to get there:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For reading and merging datasets, see Part 3 of this class. Since these are both csv files, using <code>read.csv</code> is simpler than <code>read.table</code>.</li>
<li>Using the <code>subset</code> function remove rows with zero population. You should now have 160 records. Check with the <code>dim</code> or <code>nrow</code> function.</li>
<li>Compute a new column of household size, using the households and population columns.</li>
<li>Use the <code>summary</code> function to view summary statistics, such as the mean and median.</li>
<li>For creating a histogram, see Part 6 of this class. For setting the range of the x-axis, use <code>?hist</code> to see additional arguments. Note that <code>col</code> for defining colors is a graphical parameter, for which the help file can be viewed by <code>?par</code>. For example, making the vertical line dashed, pass <code>lty=2</code> to the <code>abline</code> command.</li>
<li>Compute a new column of employment per capita.</li>
<li>Use the <code>subset</code> function to answer question 5.</li>
<li>For question 6, create a subset of the dataset corresponding to the given population (should have 92 records). Create a scatter plot of households and employment for this subsets, as well as a <code>x=y</code> line. To what city does the biggest outlier belong to? Answer the last question by a visual assessment of the scatter plot.</li>
