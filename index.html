                        <p>11/17/2020</p>
                        <p>This module covers an introduction to R, from basic data structures to simple graphs. You will learn 
                            how to load external datasets, extract, transform and summarize data, as well as how to quickly 
                            visualize simple relations in the data. This module is for beginners or for those who want to refresh
                            their knowledge in R basics.</p>

                        <p>Building on the previous module, you will learn how to write and understand functions, what are the 
                            control flow structures in R, how to export data and how to connect to a database. Installing and 
                            using R packages will also be covered.</p>

                        <p>Learn how to visualize your data with the ggplot2 (a.k.a ggplot) library. The underlying model of ggplot
                             is the Grammar of Graphics — a way of “describing the fundamental features that underlie all 
                             statistical graphics”. By understanding graphs as layers of individual components you can build a 
                             variety of beautiful graphs with ease and flexibility.</p>

                        <p>TBD</p>
                        <p>A frequent criticism of R is its inefficiency in handling large datasets. That's where the R package 
                            data.table enters the scene. If your datasets have more than tens of thousands of rows, the data.table 
                            package is a must. In this module, you will learn the flexible and intuitive syntax of the package, 
                            which allows for time and memory efficient aggregations of huge datasets as well as fast input and 
                            output operations. data.table is a package to fall in love with and never handle data in any other 
                            way.</p>

                        <p>TBD</p>
                        <p>Leaflet is a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, used for example by the NYT and 
                            Washington Post (see a few leaflet examples). This module will cover the leaflet R package that 
                            allows you to build such maps directly from R, avoiding the need of learning the complex syntax of 
                            JavaScript. Using PSRC data, you will learn how to create beautiful interactive maps of our region 
                            in no time.</p>

                        <p>TBD</p>
                        <p>How much time do you spend trying to understand your own or your colleague's code or reproduce its 
                            results? If you like us, then a lot! With R Markdown those times are over. Your analysis becomes a 
                            document combining code with text, providing opportunities for documenting every step of the way. 
                            When the document is compiled, the code is processed, results are incorporated into the text, and a 
                            pdf or html file is created, thus immediately presentable to others. This makes every analysis 
                            reproducible and its documentation is up to date with the latest data. We recommend to use 
                            R Markdown for data analysis in every analytical team in the agency.</p>

                        <p>Interactive web apps with Shiny</p>
                        <p>TBD</p>
                        <p>Learn how to create interactive web applications with the RStudio’s Shiny library. Shiny is a 
                            framework that enables client-server interaction which allows your users to interact with your data 
                            and analysis. Shiny provides basic widgets and tools to create the user-interface and server-side 
                            functions using R. With that, you can create standalone apps, dashboards, or turn your Rmarkdown 
                            document into an interactive document. Aside from native rendering functions, Shiny apps can utilize 
                            other libraries to transform data (e.g. data.table or dplyr), embed plots (e.g. ggplot2 or plotly), 
                            maps (e.g. leaflet), or display tabular data (e.g. DT or reactable)</p>

                        <p>dplyr</p>
                        <p>TBD</p>
                        <p>dplyr is a library that helps you get your data in the right form for your planning work. Most of 
                            the time, we need to group, filter, and aggregate data to make it meaningful. You might think you 
                            already know how to do this in Excel. Well, this is a better way because someone can easily follow 
                            what you did, and it looks like you wrote a paragraph, just in code. In this class, we’ll show you 
                            how to use dplyr with our household travel survey data. We will discover how mode choices differ by 
                            people’s races, according to the travel survey.</p>

                        <p>Are you interested in finding relations between variables in your data or fit a theoretical model 
                            to the observed data? This module covers basic statistical models, such as various types of 
                            regression models. You will learn how to interpret the various model outputs and how to choose 
                            between competing models.</p>
