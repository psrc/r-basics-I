R is one of the most widely used scripting tools for data analysis and visualization. In addition to its core capabilities, it is organized around libraries (or packages), which there are currently over 16,000 of them, offering almost limitless possibilities in processing, analyzing and visualizing data. Read for example [Christy's blog post](http://psrc.github.io/2020/Why-I-like-R).  

This module covers an introduction to R, from basic data structures to simple graphs. You will learn how to load external datasets, extract, transform and summarize data, as well as how to quickly visualize simple relations in the data. This module is for beginners or for those who want to refresh their knowledge in R basics.
