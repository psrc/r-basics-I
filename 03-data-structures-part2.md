## Data frames

Data frames are similar to matrices, except each column can be a
different atomic type. A data frames is the standard structure for
storing and manipulating rectangular data sets.  Underneath the hood,
data frames are really lists, where each element is an atomic vector,
with the added restriction that they're all the same length.  As you
will see, if we pull out one column of a data frame,we will have a
vector. You will probably find that data frames are more complicated
than vectors and other data structures we have considered, but they
provide powerful capabilities.
 

Data frames can be created manually with the `data.frame` function:


~~~{.r}
df <- data.frame(id = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), x = 1:6, y = c(214:219))
df
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y
1  a 1 214
2  b 2 215
3  c 3 216
4  d 4 217
5  e 5 218
6  f 6 219

~~~

As with matrices, you can use the functions `dim`, `nrow` and `ncol` to view the dimensions of the data frame.

 We can access a column
in a `data.frame` by using the `$` operator

~~~{.r}
df$x
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6

~~~
or

~~~{.r}
df[,'x']
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6

~~~

We can add columns or rows to a data.frame using `cbind` or `rbind`
(these are the two-dimensional equivalents of the `c` function):

## Adding columns to a data frame

To add a column we can use `cbind`:


~~~{.r}
df <- cbind(df, z=6:1, caps=LETTERS[1:6])
df
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps
1  a 1 214 6    A
2  b 2 215 5    B
3  c 3 216 4    C
4  d 4 217 3    D
5  e 5 218 2    E
6  f 6 219 1    F

~~~
(`LETTERS` and `letters` are built-in constants.)

Since under the hood data frames are lists, we can add columns just like adding new elements to lists:

~~~{.r}
df$zero <- rep(0, 6)
df
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps zero
1  a 1 214 6    A    0
2  b 2 215 5    B    0
3  c 3 216 4    C    0
4  d 4 217 3    D    0
5  e 5 218 2    E    0
6  f 6 219 1    F    0

~~~


## Adding rows to a data frame 

To add a row we use `rbind`:


~~~{.r}
df <- rbind(df, data.frame(id="g", x=11, y=42, z=0, caps='G', zero=NA))
str(df)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	7 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ id  : chr  "a" "b" "c" "d" ...
 $ x   : num  1 2 3 4 5 6 11
 $ y   : num  214 215 216 217 218 219 42
 $ z   : num  6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 $ caps: chr  "A" "B" "C" "D" ...
 $ zero: num  0 0 0 0 0 0 NA

~~~


## Deleting rows and handling NA


There are multiple ways to delete a row containing `NA`:


~~~{.r}
df[-7, ]  # The minus sign tells R to delete the row
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps zero
1  a 1 214 6    A    0
2  b 2 215 5    B    0
3  c 3 216 4    C    0
4  d 4 217 3    D    0
5  e 5 218 2    E    0
6  f 6 219 1    F    0

~~~



~~~{.r}
df[!is.na(df$zero), ]  # is.na() returns TRUE where its argument is NA
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps zero
1  a 1 214 6    A    0
2  b 2 215 5    B    0
3  c 3 216 4    C    0
4  d 4 217 3    D    0
5  e 5 218 2    E    0
6  f 6 219 1    F    0

~~~



~~~{.r}
df <- na.omit(df)  # Another function for the same purpose; checks all variables
df
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps zero
1  a 1 214 6    A    0
2  b 2 215 5    B    0
3  c 3 216 4    C    0
4  d 4 217 3    D    0
5  e 5 218 2    E    0
6  f 6 219 1    F    0

~~~

## Combining data frames

We can also row-bind data.frames together:


~~~{.r}
rbind(df, df)
~~~



~~~{.output}
   id x   y z caps zero
1   a 1 214 6    A    0
2   b 2 215 5    B    0
3   c 3 216 4    C    0
4   d 4 217 3    D    0
5   e 5 218 2    E    0
6   f 6 219 1    F    0
7   a 1 214 6    A    0
8   b 2 215 5    B    0
9   c 3 216 4    C    0
10  d 4 217 3    D    0
11  e 5 218 2    E    0
12  f 6 219 1    F    0

~~~
 
## Merging data frames
Data frames can be merged on one or more columns. Create a second dataset and merge it with our `df` object:

~~~{.r}
df2 <- data.frame(id = letters[1:5], X = 101:105)
df2
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id   X
1  a 101
2  b 102
3  c 103
4  d 104
5  e 105

~~~



~~~{.r}
df <- merge(df, df2, by="id", all=TRUE)
df
~~~



~~~{.output}
  id x   y z caps zero   X
1  a 1 214 6    A    0 101
2  b 2 215 5    B    0 102
3  c 3 216 4    C    0 103
4  d 4 217 3    D    0 104
5  e 5 218 2    E    0 105
6  f 6 219 1    F    0  NA

~~~

## Reading in data

Now we want to load our data into R. We will use PSRC land use data, particularly in this lesson the number of households in cities.
Before reading in data, it's a good idea to have a look at its structure.
Let's take a look using our newly-learned shell skills:


~~~{.r}
cd data/ # navigate to the data directory of the project folder
head city__table__households.csv
~~~




~~~{.output}
city_id,households_2010,households_2020,households_2030,households_2040
49.0,43742.0,49969.0,52608.0,57695.0
94.0,13996.0,16912.0,20425.0,24603.0
95.0,40735.0,50907.0,61703.0,73879.0
96.0,2276.0,2484.0,2593.0,2753.0
97.0,762.0,759.0,787.0,822.0
98.0,16315.0,19519.0,20639.0,21839.0
99.0,958.0,1020.0,1126.0,1258.0
100.0,7130.0,8706.0,8867.0,9150.0
101.0,8078.0,9479.0,10496.0,11484.0

~~~

As its file extension would suggest, the file contains comma-separated
values, and seems to contain a header row.

We can use `read.table` to read this into R:


~~~{.r}
hh <- read.table(file="data/city__table__households.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  city_id households_2010 households_2020 households_2030 households_2040
1      49           43742           49969           52608           57695
2      94           13996           16912           20425           24603
3      95           40735           50907           61703           73879
4      96            2276            2484            2593            2753
5      97             762             759             787             822
6      98           16315           19519           20639           21839

~~~

Because we know the structure of the data, we're able
to specify the appropriate arguments to `read.table`.
Without these arguments, `read.table` will do its
best to do something sensible, but it is always more
reliable to explicitly tell `read.table` the structure
of the data. `read.csv` function provides a convenient shortcut
for loading in CSV files.


~~~{.r}
# Here is the read.csv version of the above command
hh <- read.csv(file="data/city__table__households.csv")
head(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  city_id households_2010 households_2020 households_2030 households_2040
1      49           43742           49969           52608           57695
2      94           13996           16912           20425           24603
3      95           40735           50907           61703           73879
4      96            2276            2484            2593            2753
5      97             762             759             787             822
6      98           16315           19519           20639           21839

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later. It can be then run using the `source` function, using the file path
as its argument (or by pressing the "source" button in RStudio).

## Using data frames


To recap what we've just learned, let's have a look at our example
data (mumber of households in various cities for various years).

Remember, there are a few functions we can use to interrogate data structures in R:


~~~{.r}
class() # what is the data structure?
typeof() # what is its atomic type?
length() # how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
attributes() # does it have any metadata?
str() # A full summary of the entire object
dim() # Dimensions of the object - also try nrow(), ncol()
~~~

Let's use them to explore the household dataset.


~~~{.r}
class(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "data.frame"

~~~

The household data is stored in a "data.frame". This is the default
data structure when you read in data, and (as we've heard) is useful
for storing data with mixed types of columns.

Let's add a column with the name of each city and merge the two datasets:


~~~{.r}
cities <- read.table(file="data/cities.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(cities)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  city_id       city_name county_id
1      49 Snohomish-Rural         1
2      94        Lynnwood         1
3      95         Everett         1
4      96           Brier         1
5      97      Brier MUGA         1
6      98         Edmonds         1

~~~
Let's look at some of the columns.

~~~{.r}
typeof(cities$city_id)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "integer"

~~~



~~~{.r}
typeof(cities$city_name)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "character"

~~~
If you were expecting a the answer to be "character", you would rightly be
surprised by the answer. Let's take a look at the class of this column:


~~~{.r}
class(cities$city_name)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "character"

~~~
One of the default behaviours of R is to treat any text columns as "factors"
when reading in data. The reason for this is that text columns often represent
categorical data, which need to be factors to be handled appropriately by
the statistical modeling functions in R.

However it's not obvious behaviour, and something that trips many people up. We can
disable this behaviour and read in the data again.


~~~{.r}
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
cities <- read.table(file="data/cities.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
class(cities$city_name)
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "character"

~~~

Remember, if you do turn it off automatic conversion to factors you will need to
explicitly convert the variables into factors when
running statistical models.
This can be useful, because it forces you to think about the
question you're asking, and makes it easier to specify the ordering of the categories.

However there are many in the R community who find it more sensible to
leave this as the default behaviour.

>should be in your scripts, where they are visible.


Let's merge the cities dataset with our households dataset.

~~~{.r}
hh <- merge(hh, cities, by="city_id", all=TRUE)
head(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  city_id households_2010 households_2020 households_2030 households_2040

~~~
Let's add names of counties.

~~~{.r}
counties <- data.frame(county_id=1:4, county_name=c("Snohomish", "King", "Kitsap", "Pierce"))
hh <- merge(hh, counties, by="county_id", all=TRUE)
head(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
  county_id city_id households_2010 households_2020 households_2030
1         0      56              NA              NA              NA

3         1     109           14853           17874           18051

6         1     108            4464            4986            5398

The first thing you should do when reading data in, is check that it matches what
you expect, even if the command ran without warnings or errors. The `str` function,
short for "structure", is really useful for this:


~~~{.r}
str(hh)
~~~



~~~{.output}
'data.frame':	142 obs. of  8 variables:
 $ county_id      : int  0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ city_id        : num  56 140 109 113 110 108 104 105 111 103 ...
 $ households_2010: num  NA NA 14853 9488 4836 ...
 $ households_2020: num  NA NA 17874 12157 5808 ...
 $ households_2030: num  NA NA 18051 13841 6218 ...
 $ households_2040: num  NA NA 18542 15639 6688 ...
 $ city_name      : chr  "Covington PAA" "Enumclaw" "Everett MUGA" "Lake Stevens" ...
 $ county_name    : chr  NA NA "Snohomish" "Snohomish" ...

~~~

We can see that the object is a `data.frame` with 142 observations (rows),
and 8 variables (columns). Below that, we see the name of each column, followed
by a ":", followed by the type of variable in that column, along with the first
few entries.

We can retrieve or modify the column or row names
of the data.frame:


~~~{.r}
colnames(hh) 
~~~



~~~{.output}
[1] "county_id"       "city_id"         "households_2010" "households_2020"
[5] "households_2030" "households_2040" "city_name"       "county_name"    

~~~



~~~{.r}
colnames(hh)[3:6] <- paste0("hh", seq(10, 40, by=10))
head(hh, n=10)

See those numbers in the square brackets on the left? That tells you
the number of the first entry in that row of output. 

There are a few related ways of retrieving and modifying this information.
`attributes` will give you both the row and column names, along with the
class information, while `dimnames` will give you just the rownames and
column names.

In both cases, the output object is stored in a `list`:


~~~{.r}
str(dimnames(hh))
~~~



~~~{.output}
List of 2
 $ : chr [1:142] "1" "2" "3" "4" ...
 $ : chr [1:8] "county_id" "city_id" "hh10" "hh20" ...

~~~

We can look at some summary statistics:

~~~{.r}
summary(hh)
