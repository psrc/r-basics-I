## Data Types

Before we can analyse any data, we'll need to have a strong
understanding of the basic data types and data structures. It is **Very
Important** to understand because these are the things you will
manipulate on a day-to-day basis in R, and are the source of most
frustration encountered by beginners.

R has 5 basic atomic types (meaning they can't be broken down into anything smaller):

* logical (e.g., `TRUE`, `FALSE`)
* numeric
    * integer (e.g, `2L`, `as.integer(3)`)
    * double (i.e. decimal) (e.g, `-24.57`, `2.0`, `pi`)
* complex (i.e. complex numbers) (e.g, `1 + 0i`, `1 + 4i`)
* text (called "character" in R) (e.g, `"a"`, `"swc"`, `'This is a cat'`)

There are a few functions we can use to interrogate data in R to determine its type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
typeof() # what is its atomic type?
is.logical() # is it TRUE/FALSE data?
is.numeric() # is it numeric?
is.integer() # is it an integer?
is.complex() # is it complex number data?
is.character() # is it character data?
str()  # what is it?
```


## Data Structures

There are five data structures you will commonly encounter in R. These are:

* vector
* matrix
* factor
* list
* data.frame

For now, let's focus on vectors in more detail, to discover more about data types.

### Vectors

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in `R` and is pretty much
the workhorse of R. They are sometimes referred to as atomic vectors, because
importantly, they can **only contain one data type**. They are the building blocks of
every other data structure.

Create a vector of empty strings of length 10
```{r}
x <- vector("character", length = 10)  # with a predefined length and type
x
```
Initialize a vector with the same value
```{r}
x <- rep(0, 10)
x
```

Or we can use the **c** function to combine any values we like into
a vector (so long as they're the same atomic type!).

```{r}
x <- c(10, 12, 45, 33)
x
```

You can also create vectors as sequence of numbers

```{r}
y <- 1:10
y
```

```{r}
seq(10)
```

```{r}
seq(1, 10, by = 0.1)
```

> z <- c(10L, 12L, 45L, 33L)
> is.integer(z)
> ```

You can also use the concatenate function to add elements to a vector:

```{r}
x <- c(x, 57)
x
c(x,y)
```

Create a logical vector
```{r}
z <- c(rep(TRUE, 3), FALSE, c(TRUE, FALSE))
z
```

> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`
>
```{r}
any(z)
all(z)
```

Character vectors can be created using the `paste` function:
```{r}
paste(1:5, 6:10, sep=",")
paste(1:5, 6:10, sep=",", collapse=" ; ")
paste("Section", 1:3)
paste("Section", 1:3, sep="")
# the same as 
paste0("Section", 1:3)
```

> xx <- c(TRUE, 2)
> xx <- c("a", TRUE)
> ```
>

This is called implicit coercion.

The coercion rule goes `logical` -> `integer` -> `numeric` -> `complex` ->
`character`.

You can also coerce vectors explicitly using the `as.<class_name>`. Example

R will try to do whatever makes the most sense for that value:

```{r}
as.character(x)
```

```{r}
as.complex(x)
```

```{r}
x <- 0:6
as.logical(x)
```

This is behaviour you will find in many programming languages. 0 is
FALSE, while every other number is treated as TRUE.
Sometimes coercions, especially nonsensical ones won't work.

In some cases, R won't be able to do anything sensible:

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
as.numeric(x)
```

A vector of "NAs" was returned, and 
so was a warning.

You can ask questions about the structure of vectors:

```{r}
x <- 0:10
tail(x, n = 2) # get the last 'n' elements
```

```{r}
head(x, n = 1) # get the first 'n' elements
```

```{r}
length(x)
```

```{r}
str(x)
```

Vectors can be named:

```{r}
x <- 1:4
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
x
```

### Matrices

Another data structure you'll likely encounter are matrices. Underneath the
hood, they are really just atomic vectors, with added dimension attributes.

We can create one with the `matrix` function. Let's generate some random data:

```{r}
set.seed(1) # make sure the random numbers are the same for each run
x <- matrix(rnorm(18), ncol = 6, nrow = 3)
x
```

```{r}
str(x)
dim(x)  # matrix dimensions
nrow(x) # number of rows
ncol(x) # number of columns
```

You can use `rownames`, `colnames`, and `dimnames` to set or
retrieve the column and rownames of a matrix. The function `length` will tell you the number of elements.

### Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be
ordered or unordered and are important for modeling functions such as
`aov()`, `lm()` and `glm()` and also in plot methods.

We can create factors using the `factor` function:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "yes"))
x
```

So we can see that the output is very similar to a character vector, but with an
attached levels component. This becomes clearer when we look at its structure:

```{r}
str(x)
```

This reveals something important: while factors look (and often behave) like
character vectors, they are actually integers under the hood, and here, we can
see that "no" is represented by a 1, and "yes" a 2.


### Lists

If you want to combine different types of data, you will need to use lists.
Lists act as containers, and can contain any type of data structure, even
themselves!

Lists can be created using `list` or coerced from other objects using `as.list()`:

```{r}
x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x
```

Each element of the list is denoted by a `[[` in the output. Inside
each list element is an atomic vector of length one containing the given values.

Lists can contain more complex objects:

```{r}
xlist <- list(a = "Research Bazaar", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist
```

In this case our list contains a character vector of length one,
a numeric vector with 10 entries, and a small data frame from
one of R's many preloaded datasets (see `?data`). We've also given
each list element a name, which is why you see `$a` instead of `[[1]]`.

Add an element to list:
```{r}
xlist$c <- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 3)
xlist
```

Lists are extremely useful inside functions. You can "staple" together lots of
different kinds of results into a single object that a function can return. In
fact many R functions which return complex output store their results in a list.

Explore objects in a list:
```{r}
names(xlist)
```

```{r}
xlist$data
```
